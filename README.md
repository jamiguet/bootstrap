# bootstrap

Set of scripts setting up a new work environment from scratch.
All my data is backed up in SpiderOak so all that these scripts do is 
setup the basic packages for my work and invoke SpiderOakOne for a new
setup. 

The setup is validated in a docker image of the version I am pointing to.
This enables to validate if any of my steps break.

## Usage

* Clone the repo
* Run bootstrap
* Run tests

My username is hardcoded in quite a few places so it may not work for you.
